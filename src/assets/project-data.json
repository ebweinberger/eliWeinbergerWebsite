I plan to use this libary to make an attractive frontend for the social media heat map that I am making. Vercel is a platform that let me host the static webpage easily. I plan to use it for future projects so this was a good introduction to it.",

    "about": "This project is still being built. It will be a heatmap of social media activity. I any location data available that is attached to individual posts and drop a pin on the map where that post took place. Right now I have built a python script that gets tweet location information and plots it using logitude and latitude. I plan to create a nice front end for it using p5js and possibly load it to a raspberry pi to use as a dynamic art piece."
